# SoulMaker — Worklog & current state

**Updated**: 2026-09-18

## Current thread

- **Objective**: P1 map editor — pause modal (Start/ESC) + ground relief (EDIT_FLOOR) follow-up + fog presets next
- **Expected mode**: edit
- Next step: human pause recipe (below) + import check clean; commit AFTER human OK (not requested yet).
- **Last step done**: pause modal refactored to zero menu-specific scenes — `GenericMenu.configure()` runtime params (`call`/`delete_call`/`on_cancel`, inner HUD auto-hidden in modal); pause + quit-confirm are plain `generic_menu.tscn` instances. Import clean.

## Test recipe (human) — EDIT_FLOOR relief

1. Launch (boots the hub now) → Map editor → library → New (or open a map): ground flat gray as before.
2. Press Y (gamepad) or P (keyboard) → floor mode: HUD shows `FLOOR (__,__) h=+0.0` + hint line, crosshair hidden, flat yellow quad = cell cursor.
3. LS/WASD moves the cursor (coords update in HUD). RS up (or Shift+W) raises the hovered cell in 0.5 m steps — a mound grows; RS down digs a pit (down to −8, up to +8, stops at bounds).
4. A/E → toast "floor checkpoint"; sculpt more elsewhere; B/Q → relief snaps back to the checkpoint (toast); Y/P exits (relief kept, crosshair back).
5. Start (or S / ESC) → pause modal: SAVE → toast + stays in editor; CANCEL → resumes; QUIT (clean) → back to library; reopen → relief + placements back (report if not).
6. Place an asset on a mound → it sits on the relief; grab + move it → its base follows the relief.
7. R1+Y (or Shift+P) → playtest (fly over the relief); Y/P exits. Note: fly camera only — walking the slopes comes with the P2 walker; judge the relief visually.
8. Report: sculpt feel (cursor/height rates too fast/slow?), any visible hitch while holding height, all `[MapEditor]` log lines, relief after reload.

## Test recipe (human) — pause modal

1. In the editor (clean map): Start → `MAP PAUSED` (SAVE / CANCEL / QUIT). CANCEL (or B, or Start again) resumes.
2. SAVE → toast "saved …", stays in editor. Edit (place/move/sculpt) → Start → QUIT → `UNSAVED CHANGES` (QUIT WITHOUT SAVING / CANCEL). CANCEL returns to the pause; WITHOUT SAVING returns to the library without saving.
3. Clean map → QUIT quits directly (no confirm).
4. Grab an asset (or enter floor mode) → Start → pause opens, state kept; CANCEL resumes grab/floor intact. Start in playtest → nothing (exit = Y/P).
5. Report: modal readable over the scene, every `[MapEditor]`/`[Menu]` log line, any input leaking through (camera moving behind the modal = bug).

## Test recipe (human) — map menu round-trip

1. Launch the project (boots the menu, not the editor). Arrows/D-pad move the highlight (first row = New).
2. A/E on New → `untitled_01`, straight into the editor (empty map). Place 2 assets, Start → SAVE, Start → QUIT → back to menu, map listed.
3. A/E on the map row → editor reopens WITH the 2 assets (reload works!).
4. X on the row → armed red text ("DELETE ? X / B") → B cancels → X, X deletes (row gone, neighbor selected).
5. Gamepad only, then keyboard only: strict 1:1. Report: rows, highlight, prints, any break.

## Open items / waiting on you

- Live test of the tabbed catalog (recipe above).
- Gamepad live test on the map editor (earlier recipe, overlapping — the D-pad role changed to catalog navigation; object nudge is deferred to the move rework).
- Deferred spikes: ShapeCast3D (REPORTED), Foot IK + Upper/lower (FAIL).

## Status snapshot

- **P0 complete** ✓ — spikes (retarget ✓, markers ✓, Foot IK ❌, Upper/lower ❌, ShapeCast3D ⏭ REPORTED), schemas v0.1 + versioning, `decisions.md` (ADR), repo structure + naming conventions, autoload `GameState`.
- Next phase: **P1 — map editor vertical slice** (the core maker loop). Input layer (keyboard+gamepad, data-driven) shipped 16/09/2026; catalog panel tabbed by category 17/09/2026; camera zoom removed 17/09/2026.
